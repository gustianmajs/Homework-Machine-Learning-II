## Files
- `SALES.txt`: The dataset used.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and predictions.
- `results.txt`: Text file containing the predictions and evaluation metrics.
- `screenshot.png`: Screenshot of the notebook.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` to see the analysis and predictions.

## Results
- RMSE: 15.02
- RÂ² Score: 0.27

### Predictions
- Advertising cost for 50 sales: $66.20 million
- Advertising cost for 100 sales: $143.43 million
- Advertising cost for 150 sales: $220.66 million

## Interpretation
